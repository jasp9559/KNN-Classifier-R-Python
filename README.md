# KNN-Classifier-R-Python
KNN Classifier problem for classifying Glass type using the composition of elements

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is an algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and classification problems. KNN algorithm uses data and classifies new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function).

Problem: A glass manufacturing plant uses different earth elements to design new glass materials based on customer requirements. For that, they would like to automate the process of classification as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually classify them. Help the company achieve its objective by correctly classifying the glass type based on the other features using KNN algorithm
